# Fearless Trial Project 
## Software Engineer

### Project Purple Cow Definition 

##### Must Haves 

1. Web application interface that uses Javascript and HTML and that is served on port 3000. 

2. Use the https://countapi.xyz api to manage counting;

3. Provide a single button to "hit" the counting api and display the current number of hits 

4. Runs locally with a single startup command 

5. Should run correctly in Chrome; don't worry about cross-browser compatibility

6. Includes a solution.md that provides relevant documentation including how to build and run the solution

##### Nice to haves 

1. Includes a Dockerfile that will run and serve the web application

2. Any components are reusable (i.e. could have multiple copies on the same page

3. The port solution is served on is configurable and documented in the solution.md

##### Addititional Guidance 

1. The customer has not yet selected particular tchnologies, so yo are free to use front-end frameworks and/or starter projects as appropriate

### Assignment 

1. Build a proof of concept according to the requirements above and check it into a public Git repository (e.g Github) and link that repository in response.

	1. Git history is important, but only for the main branch 

2. In a solution.md in the root of the repository:

	1. List and future updates, changes, or outstanding code you would like to add or would reccommend be added

	2. Document any assumptions, changes, or details of the implementation that materially impact the addition of future features. 

3. Be prepared to spend 15 to 30 minutes discussing your approach and implementation with another Software Engineer.
